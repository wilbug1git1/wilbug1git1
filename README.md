# Hi, I’m @wilbug1git1

I build **AI security** and **cloud defense** tools with a focus on **Microsoft Security** (Sentinel, Defender XDR, Entra ID, Purview, Security Copilot) and **secure-by-default** AI engineering (RAG, agents, guardrails).

If you’re exploring **secure RAG/agents**, **threat hunting content**, or **Security Copilot + Sentinel workflows**, you’ll probably find something useful here.

## Featured projects

### 🛡️ Secure AI Advisor (AI security patterns + governance)
A decision-support portal for AI engineers and security teams to select modern AI patterns (RAG, Agents, Fine-tuning, MCP, etc.) and map them to actionable security controls across the Microsoft Security stack.
- Repo: https://github.com/wilbug1git1/ai_security_patterns
- Highlights: 22-pattern catalog, NIST AI RMF + OWASP LLM Top 10 crosswalks, RAG assistant, recommender, exports (PDF/PPT), Entra ID auth (PKCE)

### 🤖 AI Security Accelerator — Threat Group TTP Hunters (Security Copilot / Sentinel)
Threat hunting platform that combines MITRE ATT&CK intelligence, pre-built threat-group packs, and an AI-powered builder to generate **Security Copilot agent + promptbook YAML** and hunting workflows for Microsoft Sentinel / Defender.
- Repo: https://github.com/wilbug1git1/copilot-agents
- Highlights: Scattered Spider / APT28 / Volt Typhoon / Midnight Blizzard packs; shared agents (coverage gap, correlator, triage); semantic search over ATT&CK + Defender schemas

### 🧩 PromptArmor Advisor (VS Code “linter” for prompt security)
Real-time security analysis for LLM prompt engineering—catch prompt injection risks, missing validation, missing rate limiting, unfiltered outputs, and weak topic guardrails while you code.
- Repo: https://github.com/wilbug1git1/promptarmor-advisor

### 🕸️ OCTOBLUE Cyber Defense Portal (attack chain → graph → lab IaC)
Generate MITRE-mapped attack chains from natural-language scenarios, visualize attack paths, and produce IaC (Bicep/Terraform) for lab simulation—powered by Azure OpenAI + RAG.
- Repo: https://github.com/wilbug1git1/cyber_defense

### 🛰️ CyberINTEL Portal (CTI workspace + ATT&CK + enrichment)
CTI portal for managing threat groups + IOCs, mining cyber news feeds, mapping TTPs to ATT&CK, and doing AI-assisted research/enrichment with RAG (Azure OpenAI + ChromaDB).
- Repo: https://github.com/wilbug1git1/threat_intel_poc

## Current focus
- Secure RAG + agent patterns that hold up under real threat models
- Microsoft Sentinel hunting workflows and coverage analysis (ATT&CK-first)
- Developer-friendly guardrails for shipping LLM features safely

## Topics
Azure OpenAI • RAG (ChromaDB) • MITRE ATT&CK • Microsoft Sentinel • Defender XDR • Entra ID • Security Copilot • Python • FastAPI/Flask • React

## Moonlighting / collaborations
Open to small projects and prototypes around:
- secure RAG/agent architecture reviews
- Sentinel detections + hunting packs (ATT&CK mapped)
- Security Copilot agent/promptbook development
- LLM guardrails and prompt injection hardening
